# microservice-project

Contributors: David Hernandez & Osman Medzhytov

This microservices functions as a backend for a reddit-like application called redditLikeFrontEnd
(Linked here: https://github.com/medjitov10/redditLikeFronEnd) 

This application allows users to create an account in order to view, create and comment on posts. Users are able to do CRUD (create, read, upddate and delete) operations on comments, posts and user's profile.

This application was developed using some of the tenents of Spring, such as Spring Boot, Spring rest with a layered format of model, service, controller and respository layers.

Hibernate was used to create and query a local Postgres instance.

We used Feign to handle the inter microservices communication.

# General Approach
We held an initial, sprint planning meeting in which we discussed the needed deliverables for our application. We discussed best practices as well as our own expectations while pair programing. With those deliverables in mind we went to Pivotal Tracker and developed epics, user stories and broke every delieverable into it's own task. This ensured that we discussed everything that needed to be done down to the details, it also helped to keep us structured and on schedule. From the outset we followed pair programming (working on one computer at a time). As we worked through the delieverables we made sure to update pivotal tracker.
